Alea iacta est ("The die is cast") is a Latin phrase attributed by Suetonius (as iacta alea est [ˈjakta ˈaːlea est]) to Jul
ius Caesar on January 10, 49 BC as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy. With this step, he entered I
taly at the head of his army in defiance of the Senate and began his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The p
hrase, either in the original Latin or in translation, is used in many languages to indicate that events have passed a poin
t of no return.
